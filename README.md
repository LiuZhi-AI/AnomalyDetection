    **Time series graph datasets for event detection**: Temporal graph data where the graph changes dynamically over time in which new nodes and edges arrive or existing nodes and edges disappear.
    
    **Time series point datasets (Multivariate/Univariate)**: Temporal point data where each point has one or more attributes and the attributes change over time.
    
    **Adversarial/Attack scenario and security datasets**: Opinion fraud detection data from online review system. Cyber security data, e.g. intrusion detection with DoS, DDoS etc. attack scenario.
